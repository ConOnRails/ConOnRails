# Con On Rails
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ConOnRails/ConOnRails.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ConOnRails/ConOnRails)]

This is ConOnRails, an application for managing the operations of a small-to-medium sized convention.

By "operations", we mean specifically the tracking of incidents and information as the convention is running. Some cons
consider this to be a "security" task. CONVergence -- the convention this was originally developed for and modeled
after -- has instead an "operations" department that handles both security issues, and dealing with other incidents
such as needing to notify the hotel of necessary clean-ups or repairs.
 
In addition, the system manages the inventory of radios, and the "duty board" for who is currently in charge not just
in operations, but in all the key departments operations might need to contact, such as Hotel, Parties, Consuite, etc.

ConOnRails is derived conceptually from ConInABox by Thomas Keeley, who acted as product manager. The current theme
is derived entirely from the designs of DeNae Leverentz, who acted as our user experience expert. All coding to date
has been done by Michael Scott Shappe.

ConOnRails achieved v1.0 on 2 July 2012, right before CONvergence 2012, where it saw its maiden voyage.

(DISCLAIMER: no actual maidens were harmed in the production of this software).

There's lots of nifty things it could still use, but it now achieves everything we wanted it to for its first year
on the job. Once CONvergence 2012 is over, we'll begin regrouping for the 2.0 cycle. Current hopes for 2.0 include
smoothing over some rough areas in the UI/UX, and making more things configurable. It is the long-term goal of this
project to be useful to other conventions, but we recognize that, in order to do that, lots of things that are currently
hardwired for CONvergence will need to be made configurable.
