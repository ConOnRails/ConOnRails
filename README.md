# Con On Rails

This is ConOnRails, an application for managing the operations of a small-to-medium sized convention.

By "operations", we mean specifically the tracking of incidents and information as the convention is running. Some cons consider this to be a "security" task. CONVergence -- the convention this was originally developed for and modeled after -- has instead an "operations" department that handles both security issues, and dealing with other incidents such as needing to notify the hotel of necessary clean-ups or repairs. 
 
In addition, the system manages the inventory of radios, the "shift board" for the operations department, and the "duty board" for who is currently in charge not just in operations, but in all the key departments operations might need to contact, such as Hotel, Parties, Consuite, etc.

ConOnRails is derived conceptually from ConInABox by Thomas Keeley.

At this time, ConOnRails is EXTREMELY embrionic, and not really useful, yet. I'm only making it "public" to make it easier to share the code with intended collaborators, but I didn't see any reason to make a "private" repository, as there's no secret sauce here to protect.

Stay tuned for more, better, niftier stuff as the application actually moves toward usability!

PS. I haven't applied it to the source files yet, but assume Apache 2.0 licencing.
